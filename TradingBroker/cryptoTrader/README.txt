Instructions:
Start the program using MainUI.java.
Once the program is running, you will be asked if you have an account.
If you do not have an account, select "No" and create one.
Log in with your credentials.

Once in the main GUI, you can create trading clients, the coins they are
interested in, and their trading strategy.

To add multiple trading clients, click the "Add Row", this adds one more row
for the trading clients.

To remove trading clients, select the row you wish to delete, and click
"Remove Row"

To view the cryptocurrencies available you can select the 
"Display Cryptocurrencies" button.

Make sure the coin list is filled in the exact same as the name is written in the
"Display Cryptocurrencies" tab.

Once the trading clients are fully created you can trade with the 
"Perform Trade" button.

Once trade has been performed, you will see two new tabs appear.

The "Trader Actions" tab shows each trade completed and info about the trade
including, strategy, the coin type, the action, quantity, price, and date.

The "Actions Performed By Traders So Far" tab will display a histogram showing
the previous trades completed and their strategies.
